# Generative Art: Extinct Birds

This project is a generative art installation for a Creative Embedded Systems. For more information about the project and installation, see: https://medium.com/@ah3820/generative-art-extinct-birds-ab901cde062e. 

A video of the installation can be seen here: https://youtu.be/UrT2fVI6Llg.

The aim of this project was to create a visually impactful and interesting display about the extinction of birds. The project used the ESP32 TTGO T-Display Module. To recreate this project with the same hardware, simply download the code in generative-art.ino and use the Arduino IDE to flash the code to the ESP32. Make sure to also download the image.h file in the same project directory since it contains the information required to display the background image. 

Once the code has been uploaded to the board, it should look something like the example below with the background image of birds scrolling behind the text.
